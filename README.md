# Gaming Industry Analysis

This project analyzes the gaming industry over the years, including new game releases, platform lifespan, total sales, sales performance, user and critic ratings, and genre trends. The dataset used for this analysis contains information on over 16,000 games released between 1980 and 2020.

## Findings

- The number of new games released is gradually increasing since 2000 and skyrocketed between 2007 and 2010, then declined after 2011.
- The average lifespan of a platform is approximately 7.6 years, with a standard deviation of 0.18 years.
- The top 10 platforms by total sales are dominated by PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and DS.
- The sales performance of games can vary widely, with some games experiencing steep declines while others experience a gradual decrease in sales.
- There is a positive correlation between user scores and total sales for games on the PlayStation 4. Higher user scores are generally associated with higher total sales.
- There is a negative correlation between critic scores and total sales for games on the PlayStation 4. Higher critic scores are generally associated with lower total sales.
- Action and Sports games have the highest total sales and market share across genres, and Shooter and Platform games have the highest average sales over the long period.
- The results of hypothesis tests indicate that there is a statistically significant difference between the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms in the population, as well as between the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights the significant changes the gaming industry has experienced in recent years. Developers and publishers need to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and platform trends to remain relevant in the market. The success of a game is influenced by factors such as user and critic scores, genre, and platform, which game developers and publishers should consider when designing and marketing their games to optimize sales and user satisfaction.
